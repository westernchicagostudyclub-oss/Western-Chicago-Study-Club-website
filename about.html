                <h2>Why Western Chicago?</h2>
                <p>The western suburbs of Chicago represent a diverse and growing community of dental practices. We saw an opportunity to bring together the exceptional talent in our area—from Naperville to Lombard and Downers Grove to Glen Ellyn, Wheaton, and beyond—to create something greater than the sum of its parts. By fostering local connections, we make collaboration practical and referral relationships stronger.</p>
